1. What is a Node module?

A Node module is a set of functions that can be included into an application.
They are the same as what are known as libraries in other languages.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

module.exports is an empty object that can be reassigned to anything. 
if module.exports gets overwritten, anything else attached to it cannot be invoked.
exports on the other hand, is a reference to module.exports and cannot reassign
the module.exports object. 

3. Why is using exports recommended?

exports is recommended because of the fact that it is not affected
in the case that it gets overwritten, making it less prone to errors 
that may occur when using module.exports.
